    "## Task\n",
    "You are to create the following geometric classes:\n",
    "- Rectangle\n",
    "- Circle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You might also need additional class(es) if you wish to utilize inheritance and/or composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes should have:\n",
    "- An `area` property.\n",
    "- A `circumference` property.\n",
    "- An operator overload of `==` for equality check.\n",
    "- An operator overload of comparison operators `<`,`>`,`<=`,`>=` for comparisons.\n",
    "- An override of `__repr__()`.\n",
    "- An override of `__str__()`.\n",
    "- `x` and `y` which represent the center position of the object.\n",
    "- A translation method that allows movement of `x` and `y`.\n",
    "- A method that checks if a certain point is inside the object.\n",
    "- Error handling.\n",
    "- A method that checks if the circle instance is a unit circle.\n",
    "- A method that checks if the rectangle instance is a square.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add more suitable functionalities as deemed appropriate. For instance, it would be nice to be able to visually represent the geometric figures and observe translations. Your classes should be contained in a `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating a plan with diagrams.net and then implement your plan in Python. It's perfectly fine to use other software to create UML or to do one with paper and pencil. Perform manual tests, similar to the above, but test more. A tip is to have a `.ipynb` file on the side that imports your classes to conduct manual tests while you're writing the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Tasks (Optional)\n",
    "- Create a cube class with corresponding functionalities.\n",
    "- Create a sphere class with corresponding functionalities.\n",
    "- Reflect on how various methods, properties change, e.g., area, circumference.\n",
    "- Unit test your classes.\n",
    "- Have a separate `.py` file for the unit tests."
